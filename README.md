# Scrape
This program scrapes courses details from pluralsight by a search keyword,it uses selenium for scraping websites that have a search bar and requires a bit of automation.
The output is in the form of key-value pairs which will be shown in the console.

PS: change the delay to what you wish, i have set it to 600 so it would wait longer for poor internet connection issues.
